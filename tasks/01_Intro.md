# Task 01: Complete by January 13 
* Make a 1-page or less bullet-pointed cheat sheet of best practices for reproducible research.
* Write a paragraph describing the "Reinhart-Rogoff affair" and what it has to do with open science and reproducible data analysis. 
* For your edification (this is not really a task, I just want you to spend a few minutes staring into the abyss of real-world data practices): Spend a few minutes looking at the `chon_rates.xlsx` spreadsheet. This is a spreadsheet used to measure size distributions of polysaccharides, which have been determined by chromatography, and uses those size distributions to calculate the number of cuts that would be required to transition from one distribution to the other. Use the `Trace Precedents` and `Trace Dependents` functions to figure out what this spreadsheet is actually doing. You won't be able to figure it out, but using those two functions to do forensic analysis of Excel spreadsheets is a critical data analysis skill.
