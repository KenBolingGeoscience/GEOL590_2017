# Resources

## Markup languages

* Knuth () Literate Programming, 
    * Or you could read the Wikipedia article about the book, which is pretty good
* Schulte et al (2012), Journal of Statistical Software, *sections 1 and 2 only*. This article describes an environment called Org-mode. We won't be using Org-mode, but this is a decent explanation of how to implement a literate software environment (esp. Fig 1, showing weaving and tangling)
* Xie on Knitr
* Daring Fireball markdown syntax. (Note that github uses a slightly different flavor - github markdown, explained here)
* [Sweave manual](http://wiki.leg.ufpr.br/lib/exe/fetch.php/projetos:obesidade:sweave-rnews-2002-3.pdf)
* Somethign about LaTeX

# Tasks

[Take your own data, or use one of the datasets I've provided. Create an R notebook (interactive .Rmd file) to analyze the data in some way. This should contain a brief introduction, and a Results/Discussion section, including a plot. Create an .html output (which creates, as an intermediary, an .md file). Post **both** the .Rmd file, and the resulting .md file, to github. NOte that you will also need to include the image files that go with teh markdown file. ]
